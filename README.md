# 🏠 House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices using regression techniques on the **Kaggle House Prices – Advanced Regression Techniques dataset**.

---

## 📌 Objective

Predict the sale price of houses based on various features like location, area, year built, number of rooms, etc., using regression models.
